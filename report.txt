## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Rate Limits from NASA APIs
**Problem**: NASA APIs enforce rate limits which caused HTTP 429 errors during extraction.  
**Solution**: Implemented retries with exponential backoff and limited requests per second.

---

### 2. Heterogeneous Data Formats
**Problem**: APOD, NeoWs, and Mars Rover APIs return differently structured JSON with various nested fields.  
**Solution**: Developed custom parsers per API, standardized all timestamps, and normalized nested structures.

---

### 3. Image Analysis at Scale
**Problem**: Analyzing images from Mars Rover and APOD could lead to timeout or memory issues.  
**Solution**: Resized and downsampled images before analysis; limited image metadata to dominant color and resolution.

---

### 4. Secure and Scalable Hosting
**Problem**: Needed to expose an HTTP endpoint for image analysis without heavy AWS cost.  
**Solution**: Used AWS Lightsail to host the FastAPI service with Nginx and Gunicorn, using a firewall for access control.

---

### 5. Error Resilience in ETL
**Problem**: Glue jobs would silently fail if external services timed out.  
**Solution**: Wrapped external API calls in try/except blocks with fallback values and logged errors to CloudWatch.
